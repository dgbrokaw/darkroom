Your job is to determine whether the paired objects revealed in the right and left screens follow a consistent pattern. The objects in each pair will always occur with the same location and same color in both screens. Objects occurring in different locations or with different colors in the two screens do not belong to the same pair. For example, below each object on the right screen has an opposite fill from its paired object on the left screen. Shapes on the left that are solid have unfilled paired counterparts on the right. Shapes on the left that are unfilled have solid paired counterparts on the right.</p>'
